# Weather Forecast Python Application

This is a simple Python application that allows you to find the current weather of a city using the [WeatherAPI](https://weatherapi.com/) service. You can specify the city, and the application will provide you with the current temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, as well as the location and date and time of the forecast.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements:

- Python installed on your system (you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
- An API key from [WeatherAPI](https://weatherapi.com/) (Sign up and get your API key).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MrRohanBatra/weather-forecast-python.git
   ```

2. Change your current working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd weather-forecast-python
   ```

3. The `weather.py` will automatically detect your WeatherAPI API key.For the first time you have to enter it next time it will detect automatically(only windows users).

## Usage

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python weather.py
   ```

4. You will be prompted to enter the name of the city for which you want to get the weather forecast. Enter the city name in the format `(city,country)` and press Enter.

5. The application will retrieve the weather data from WeatherAPI and display the current weather information for the specified city, including location, temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, and the date and time of the forecast.

## Example

Here's an example of how the application works:

```bash
Enter city name in the format (city,name)
Ans: New York, USA

->The weather for the day is..................
->Location: New York, USA
->Temperature: 20°C || 68°F
->Date: 2023-11-02 15:47
```
